# EdgeSquirrelDetector

Plan:

1. Figure out hardware to use
Raspberry pi 3 b+ with v2 camera (train a model to work on the 5 too)

Note specs of each: processors, ram, camera resolution

3. Figure out software to use
Check for models that are complex enough to work but small enough to run

4. Figure out data to use
Find the type(s) of squirrel that occur(s) often in Washington

5. Get/annotate data
Check iNaturalist for some labeled data, label it with label studio?

7. Implement (train) software
Get cluster workflow setup, train on cluster

9. Test on the edge hardware
Make a simple test script that lights an LED when a squirrel is detected.

11. Enjoy your results
Yay.
